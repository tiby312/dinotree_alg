//! An iterative mulithreaded hybrid kdtree/mark and sweep algorithm used for broadphase detection.
//! ## Goal
//! To provide a fast and simple to use broad-phase collision system.
//!
//! ## Notes                      
//!
//! Checkout included examples. 
//!
//! The mutable reference to each element in the callback functions do not point to elements
//! in the user supplied slice of elements. The elements are internally unsafely copied directly into a tree structure
//! and then unsafely copied back into the slice at the end. So do not try storing the mutable references as pointers
//! in the callback functions since they would point to unallocated memory once the tree is destroyed.
//!
//! ## Use of unsafety           
//!
//! The multirect api uses unsafety internally. We unsafely convert the refernces returned by the rect query
//! closure to have a longer lifetime.
//! This allows the user to store mutable references of non intersecting rectangles at the same time. 
//! The multirect api panics at run time if the user attemps to query
//! rectangles that intersect. This protects the invariant at runtime. So it this use unsafety can be hidden by the api.
//!
//! The bots are unsafely copied into a tree, and then usafely copied back out. The algorithm ensures
//! That even though the ordering is different, this is a bijection between the two sets.
//! So we can safely hide this unsafety from the user.
//! The bots are copied back in the trees drop() method. If the user panics inside of a callback function,
//! The changes to the bots up until that more during the traversal of the tree will take effect when the 
//! trees drop() occurrs.
//!
//! The sequential version of the pair intersection uses unsafe{} to re-use code from the parallel version.
//! That is protected at runtime. It will panic if the parallel version tries to copy the closure.
//!
//! Unsafety is used to construct the special variable node size tree structure that is populated with dsts.
